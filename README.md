## Financial ratio performance analysis - Netflix and Disney

Tech Stack: Excel

Core Focus: Cash Conversion & Earnings Quality Analysis


Project Overview
----
The project includes structured five-year ratio calculations and a dashboard built in Excel. Key metrics analyzed include Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin, Free Cash Flow Margin, Operating Cash Flow Margin, CFO/Net Income (earnings quality), and Cash Conversion Ratio. Each ratio is evaluated directionally (improving, volatile, stabilizing) and benchmarked against reference thresholds relevant for subscription and service-based businesses.


Project Structure
----
The project includes structured five-year ratio calculations and a dashboard built in Excel. Key metrics analyzed include:


* Operating Margin (%)
* Net Profit Margin (%)
* Free Cash Flow (USD mn)
* Free Cash Flow Margin (%)
* Operating Cash Flow / Net Income (x)
* Operating Cash Flow Margin (%)
* Cash Conversion Ratio (x)

Five-year trend analysis (2021–2025) is included for each ratio


Excel Dashboard display
----
The dashboard visually presents:
* Profitability trends
* Cash flow margins
* Earnings quality validation (CFO / Net Income)
* Revenue comparison (converted to billions)
* Directional trend indicators (improving, stabilizing, volatile, deteriorating)

The layout follows a financial storytelling structure:

Profitability → Cash Flow → Earnings Quality



Key Findings
---
The analysis shows that Netflix delivers stronger margin efficiency relative to its revenue base, supported by its asset-light subscription-driven model and scalable digital infrastructure. Disney generates significantly higher absolute revenue but operates within a capital-intensive, diversified structure that affects margin stability and cash conversion dynamics. Netflix demonstrates improving alignment between operating income and operating cash flow, while Disney consistently generates operating cash flow above net income, though with greater volatility due to reinvestment cycles and working capital movements. The structural differences between a focused OTT model and a diversified conglomerate are clearly reflected in profitability dispersion and cash flow behavior...

Conclusion
---
The comparison highlights how business model structure materially influences financial performance. Netflix’s focused digital subscription model supports higher margin efficiency and improving cash translation, whereas Disney’s diversified, multinational entertainment ecosystem provides revenue scale but introduces operational complexity and capital intensity. The project emphasizes that assessing financial health requires moving beyond headline profits to evaluate sustainability through cash flow strength and earnings quality metrics.
